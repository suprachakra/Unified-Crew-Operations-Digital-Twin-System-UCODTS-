## Security Policy

### Overview
UCODTS backend is built with security as a top priority. This document outlines our security practices, including vulnerability management, encryption standards, and incident response.

### Key Security Practices
- **Zero Trust Architecture:**  
  All services use TLS/SSL for secure communication and JWT/OAuth2 for authentication.
- **Encryption:**  
  Data in transit is encrypted with TLS; data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Regular Audits:**  
  Automated security scans and periodic penetration testing are conducted.
- **Incident Response:**  
  A documented incident response plan is in place, including rollback procedures and emergency shutdown protocols.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities
- Please report any security issues to our security team at security@ucodts.com.
