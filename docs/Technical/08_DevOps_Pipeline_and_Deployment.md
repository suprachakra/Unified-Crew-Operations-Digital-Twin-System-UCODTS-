## DevOps Pipeline and Deployment

### Overview
This document describes the CI/CD workflows, deployment strategies, and cloud infrastructure configurations for UCODTS. Our approach ensures seamless, automated deployments, robust monitoring, and effective rollback procedures to guarantee high system availability and performance.

### CI/CD Workflows
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  - Automated builds, tests, and security scans on every commit using GitHub Actions.
- **Continuous Deployment:**  
  - Deployment pipelines support blue-green and canary deployments.
  - Automated rollback strategies are triggered when performance thresholds are not met.
  
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform:**  
  - Scripts manage cloud resource provisioning for consistent, reproducible deployments.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:**  
  - Containerization of all microservices.
  - Kubernetes orchestrates auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing.
  
### Rollback and Disaster Recovery
- **Rollback Procedures:**  
  - Documented steps for rolling back a deployment if critical failures are detected.
  - Integrated within CI/CD workflows to trigger automatic rollback.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Multi-region deployments with redundant instances.
  - Regular automated backups and defined recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Use of Prometheus and Grafana for real-time system health monitoring.
- **Logging:**  
  - Centralized logging using the ELK Stack for detailed error tracking and troubleshooting.

### Summary
Our DevOps strategy ensures that UCODTS is deployed safely, scales seamlessly, and maintains high availability. Detailed rollback and disaster recovery procedures, combined with continuous monitoring, guarantee a resilient deployment pipeline.
