## AI Model Documentation

AI and machine learning are core to UCODTS, providing the predictive analytics that drive proactive decision-making. This document outlines the architecture, training, deployment, and continuous improvement processes for our AI models. Comprehensive documentation ensures transparency, reproducibility, and ongoing performance optimization.

### Model Architecture
- **Overview:**  
  Our AI models are designed to predict crew fatigue, forecast maintenance needs, and anticipate operational disruptions.
- **Components:**
  - **Input Layer:** Receives normalized data from integrated data pipelines.
  - **Hidden Layers:** Use deep neural networks or ensemble methods to capture complex relationships.
  - **Output Layer:** Generates predictions such as fatigue risk scores, maintenance alerts, or disruption probabilities.
- **Frameworks Used:**  
  - TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models.
  - Scikit-learn for regression and ensemble techniques.

### Training Data and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources:**  
  - Real-time operational data (e.g., crew schedules, flight metrics, sensor readings).  
  - Historical datasets (maintenance logs, safety incidents).
- **Preprocessing Steps:**  
  - Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering performed via automated ETL pipelines.
  - Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

### MLOps Pipeline
- **Training Pipeline:**  
  - Automated data ingestion and splitting.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using methods such as Grid Search or Random Search.
  - Logging of training metrics and version control for reproducibility.
- **Deployment Pipeline:**  
  - Exporting trained models as binary files (e.g., `.h5` for TensorFlow, `.pkl` for Scikit-learn).
  - Deploying models via automated CI/CD pipelines with rollback capabilities.
- **Continuous Retraining:**  
  - Scheduled retraining processes trigger when performance metrics fall below defined thresholds.
  - Continuous monitoring and feedback loops to ensure model relevance and accuracy.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Regression Models:** RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Classification Models:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Operational Metrics:** Inference latency and throughput in real-time deployment environments.

### Guidelines for Future Model Updates
- **Version Control:** Maintain a detailed version history using Git.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track model performance continuously through integrated dashboards.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update this document with each major model change, including architecture adjustments, new hyperparameters, and performance improvements.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Incorporate user feedback to refine model outputs and align them with operational needs.

### Conclusion
The AI model documentation ensures that our predictive capabilities remain transparent, reproducible, and continuously optimized. By adhering to rigorous MLOps practices and maintaining detailed records, UCODTS is positioned to deliver accurate, actionable insights that drive operational excellence and proactive management in airline operations.
