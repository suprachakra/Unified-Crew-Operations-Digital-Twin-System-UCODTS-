## QA and Test Automation

### Overview
This document outlines the end-to-end test automation strategy for UCODTS. Our comprehensive testing approach covers unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), performance, and chaos testing to ensure that the system meets all quality, security, and performance standards.

| **Testing Type**             | **Scope**                                                   | **Tools**                     | **Coverage Target / Metrics**                 | **Key Actions**                                                         | **Notes / Risk Mitigation**                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Testing**             | Test individual functions/methods within each microservice. | pytest (Python), Jest (JS)    | ≥95% unit test coverage for critical components | - Write tests for new features.<br>- Automate tests in CI pipeline.        | Ensures early detection of bugs at the function level.                                              |
| **Integration Testing**      | Verify interactions between microservices and external systems (APIs, message queues). | Postman, pytest               | All endpoints and data flows validated        | - Simulate cross-service data flows.<br>- Validate error handling.         | Ensures reliable communication between services.                                                   |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** | Validate complete workflows from data ingestion to dashboard display. | Cypress, Selenium             | Fully automated key user journeys             | - Develop comprehensive test scripts.<br>- Ensure minimal latency and proper error handling. | Confirms system-wide functionality and user experience.                                            |
| **Performance & Load Testing** | Test system performance under peak load conditions.            | JMeter, Locust                | ≥10,000 events/sec; average latency <200ms      | - Conduct periodic stress tests.<br>- Adjust auto-scaling policies accordingly. | Validates system capacity and responsiveness.                                                      |
| **Security & Penetration Testing** | Identify vulnerabilities across APIs and microservices.         | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite         | Zero critical vulnerabilities                 | - Perform regular automated security scans.<br>- Integrate penetration tests into CI/CD. | Ensures a robust, secure system that meets regulatory requirements.                                |
| **Chaos Testing**            | Simulate failures (network outages, service crashes) to test system resilience. | Chaos Monkey, Gremlin         | System recovers automatically; 99.9% uptime maintained | - Schedule chaos experiments.<br>- Document recovery times and update procedures. | Validates system resilience and continuous availability under adverse conditions.                   |


### Continuous Integration/Deployment
- **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  Integrated with GitHub Actions to run all tests on every commit and pull request.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Real-time monitoring of test results with automated alerts for failures.

### Summary
Our QA and Test Automation strategy ensures that UCODTS is robust, secure, and high-performing. With comprehensive testing across all layers, any issues are detected early, enabling swift remediation and continuous improvement.
