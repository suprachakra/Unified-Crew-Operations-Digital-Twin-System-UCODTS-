## UX Wireframes and Design Guidelines
The UX design strategy and provides a collection of wireframes for the Unified Crew & Operations Digital Twin System (UCODTS). The wireframes are designed to create an intuitive, user-centric interface that supports real-time decision-making and operational management. This document also includes design guidelines, accessibility standards, and interaction flows to ensure a seamless user experience across all platforms.

### Design Objectives
- **User-Centric:** Prioritize intuitive navigation, clear visual hierarchy, and interactive elements that enhance user engagement.
- **Real-Time Visibility:** Provide dashboards that display live data and key performance indicators (KPIs) to support rapid decision-making.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the design complies with WCAG 2.1 AA standards to be accessible to all users.
- **Scalability:** Design components that are reusable and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Consistency:** Maintain visual and interaction consistency across all modules, ensuring a coherent brand experience.
