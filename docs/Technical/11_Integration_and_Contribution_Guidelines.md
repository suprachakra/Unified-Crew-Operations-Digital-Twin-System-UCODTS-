## Integration and Contribution Guidelines

### Overview
This document provides detailed instructions for internal integrations and external contributions to UCODTS. It outlines our coding standards, commit message conventions, branching strategies, and integration procedures to ensure a cohesive and high-quality codebase.

### Internal Integration Guidelines
- **Integration Process:**  
  - Step-by-step guides for integrating new features or modules into existing microservices.
  - Detailed API contract validation and data flow consistency checks.
- **Version Control:**  
  - All code changes must follow a feature branching strategy using Git.
  - Merges into the main branch require at least two code reviews.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Automated builds, tests, and security scans are triggered on every commit via GitHub Actions.

### External Contribution Guidelines
- **Contribution Standards:**  
  - Adhere to the coding standards documented in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
  - Follow commit message conventions and branch naming rules.
- **Pull Request Requirements:**  
  - Provide detailed descriptions, reference related issues, and include new test cases.
  - Ensure your contribution passes all automated tests and security scans.
- **Communication Channels:**  
  - Use designated channels (GitHub Issues, Slack) for questions and clarifications.

### Summary
These guidelines ensure that both internal and external contributors maintain consistent, high-quality code integration. Clear processes and strict standards help maintain the integrity and reliability of the UCODTS codebase.
