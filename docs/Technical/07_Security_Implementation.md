## Security Implementation

### Overview
This document details the security architecture and protocols implemented within UCODTS. Adhering to a Zero Trust model, the system ensures that all data is protected in transit and at rest while complying with industry regulations. Detailed incident response and disaster recovery procedures are also defined.

### Security Architecture

#### 1. Zero Trust Model
- **Principles:**  
  - Verify explicitly, assume breach, and enforce least privilege.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Use TLS/SSL for all service communications.
  - Authenticate all requests using JWT/OAuth2.
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC).

#### 2. Data Encryption
- **In Transit:**  
  - All API calls secured with TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **At Rest:**  
  - Data stored in databases is encrypted using AES-256.

#### 3. Compliance and Auditing
- **Standards:**  
  - Adherence to GDPR, IATA, and ISO 27001 standards.
- **Auditing:**  
  - Regular internal and external security audits.
  - Automated vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

#### 4. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery
- **Incident Response:**  
  - Defined incident response procedures with clear escalation paths.
  - Automated alerts and rapid patch deployment.
- **Rollback & Recovery:**  
  - Detailed rollback procedures documented for each deployment.
  - Multi-region deployments and regular backups ensure business continuity.
  
### Risk Mitigation
- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  - Use of Prometheus and Grafana for real-time security monitoring.
- **Penetration Testing:**  
  - Regular testing with tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.
- **Fallback Strategies:**  
  - Manual override and emergency shutdown procedures for critical vulnerabilities.

### Summary
Our comprehensive security framework ensures UCODTS remains robust and compliant. With strict encryption, continuous monitoring, and clear incident response procedures, the system is prepared to handle and quickly recover from security challenges.
