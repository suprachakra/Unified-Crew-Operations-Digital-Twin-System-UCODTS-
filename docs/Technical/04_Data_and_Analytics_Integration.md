## Data and Analytics Integration

### Overview
This document outlines the data integration strategy for UCODTS, ensuring high data quality, real-time analytics, and continuous improvement of machine learning models. It details our ETL pipelines, data storage architecture, and schema design, including the necessary data model and database diagrams.

### Data Sources and ETL Pipelines
- **Data Sources:**  
  - **Real-Time Feeds:** IoT sensors from aircraft, crew check-in systems, and external APIs (flight status, weather, geopolitical events).
  - **Historical Data:** Past crew schedules, maintenance logs, and safety incident reports.
- **ETL Process:**  
  - **Extract:** Automated extraction of data from all sources.
  - **Transform:** Data cleaning, normalization, and validation using Python scripts.
  - **Load:**  
    - Processed data is loaded into PostgreSQL for transactional needs.
    - Redis is used for caching dynamic data.
    - A data lake (or NoSQL database) stores large volumes of historical data for analytics.
- **Risk Mitigation:**  
  - Automated anomaly detection ensures data consistency.
  - Redundant data sources and caching prevent data loss during peak times.

### Data Model and Schema
- **ERD Diagrams:**  
  - Detailed diagrams illustrate relationships among key entities (crew, flight, maintenance, safety, disruption).
- **Schema Documentation:**  
  - In-depth descriptions of tables, fields, primary and foreign keys, and indexing strategies.
- **ML Model Specifics:**  
  - Documentation of data requirements for training models (e.g., crew fatigue prediction, predictive maintenance).
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Scheduled retraining pipelines and model performance monitoring are in place to ensure ongoing data integrity and model accuracy.

      string type "Type of disruption (Weather, Geopolitical)"
      string description "Detailed description of disruption"
      datetime detectedTime "Time when disruption was detected"
    }

```

### Analytics Integration
- **Data Pipeline Integration:**  
  - Seamless integration between ETL processes and analytical dashboards.
- **Real-Time Analytics:**  
  - Dashboards (React-based) connected to Redis and PostgreSQL visualize key operational KPIs.
- **Reporting:**  
  - Regular analytics reports monitor performance metrics and trigger model retraining as needed.

### Summary
This document guarantees a robust, scalable, and continuously improving data integration framework for UCODTS, ensuring that our analytics are accurate, actionable, and essential for proactive decision-making.
