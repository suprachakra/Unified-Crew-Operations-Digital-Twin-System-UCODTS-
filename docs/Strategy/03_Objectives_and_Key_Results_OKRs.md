## Implementation Plan
- **Quarterly Reviews:** OKRs will be reviewed every quarter to assess progress and adjust strategies as needed.
- **Cross‑Functional Alignment:** Regular meetings between Product, Engineering, Data, QA, and Security teams will ensure that each objective is met holistically.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Key performance metrics will be tracked in real-time through our integrated dashboards, ensuring timely intervention if targets are not met.

## Ethical and Compliance Integration
- **Data Privacy & Security:**  
  Each OKR is achieved in full compliance with GDPR, IATA, and ISO 27001 standards.
- **Transparency & Accountability:**  
  Real-time dashboards and regular audits ensure complete transparency and accountability.
- **User-Centric Approach:**  
  OKRs are designed based on direct user feedback, ensuring improvements directly impact frontline operations.
